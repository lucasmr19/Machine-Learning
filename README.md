## Introduction

In this repository, you will find various implementations of Machine Learning algorithms, along with detailed analysis and model evaluation techniques. Each notebook focuses on a specific approach, covering topics like:

- Supervised Learning (Regression, Classification)
- Unsupervised Learning (Clustering, Dimensionality Reduction)
- Deep Learning (Neural Networks, CNNs, RNNs)
- Model Tuning (GridSearch, RandomSearch, Hyperparameter Optimization)
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Data Preprocessing and Cleaning

The datasets are sourced from public repositories or generated for the purpose of demonstration.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ml-techniques-repo.git
